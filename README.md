## 🚀 Overview

Modern cloud environments generate vast volumes of log data. Traditional log analysis tools struggle to handle novel attack patterns and zero-day exploits. **CloudTrail Security Analyzer** bridges that gap using:

- 🔍 **Unsupervised anomaly detection** via Isolation Forest  
- 💬 **Natural language querying** via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- 📊 **Interactive dashboards** via Streamlit  
- 🧠 **AI-assisted summarization** using Gemini 1.5 Pro

---

## 📌 Objectives

1. Detect anomalies in CloudTrail logs indicating potential threats  
2. Allow human-friendly log querying using natural language  
3. Visualize trends and flagged anomalies with interactive dashboards  

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The system is built on a modular stack consisting of:

### 🔄 Data Ingestion & Parsing

- Parses deeply nested AWS CloudTrail JSON logs (up to 4 levels)
- Extracts features like IP entropy, geolocation variance, and API usage frequency

### 🤖 Anomaly Detection

- Uses **Isolation Forest** (Scikit-learn) for unsupervised detection  
- Prioritizes incidents involving high-risk API calls or rare IP sources  

### 🧠 Natural Language Interface

- Integrates **RAG + Gemini 1.5 Pro** via ChromaDB  
- Supports queries like:  
  - _"What actions did root user take yesterday?"_  
  - _"Show failed login attempts last weekend"_  

### 📊 Streamlit Dashboard

- Upload new log files directly  
- View anomalies by:
  - Severity
  - Source IP
  - Event type
  - Timestamp  
- Issue natural language queries  
- Adjust thresholds and reprocess logs in real time
